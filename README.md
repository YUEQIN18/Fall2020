## Weekly report 9

[2020-10-26] Find an interesting program, SETI from UC Berkeley. SETI experiments are trying to determine whether other intelligent extraterrestrial life exists in the universe, to answer the question "Are we alone?" or "Is anybody out there?" Over 5.2 million volunteers take part in SETI distributed computation. Based on SETI@home, Berkeley developed BOINC, Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, which has deployed interesting research projects in biomedicine, climate change, astrophysics, cryptography, mathematical proof, and many other fields. Everyone who has a Raspberry Pi or a PC is able to participate in and contribute to BOINC programs.

## Weekly report 2

[2020-09-12] Completed Lab1A, Lab1B, Lab1D.

[2020-09-12] Set up the Raspberry Pi 4B. The process of configuring the Raspberry Pi is very strange. I can use SSH to access the Raspberry Pi in Mac, 
but not in the Windows. Because it is very slow to connect to foreign websites in China, I changed the software source to the software mirror station 
of Tsinghua University and updated the software list.
